# Swift Sources Guidance

This scope applies to all Swift code under `Sources/`.

- Target Swift 5.9+ with compatibility for iOS 18 and macOS 15 as reflected in the Core ML
  packages produced by `dolphin2coreml_full.py`.
- Keep modules free of placeholder implementationsâ€”mirror the production utilities already in
  place (Core ML wrappers, benchmark harnesses) and ensure public APIs expose thorough
  documentation comments when behaviour is non-obvious. The streaming + background execution
  patterns documented in the README must remain accurate when altering the runtime APIs.
- Maintain Core ML imports and avoid introducing platform-specific APIs without `#if canImport`
  guards.
- Prefer deterministic performance measurements and guard against unsafe pointer usage by
  validating tensor ranks and data types, as demonstrated in existing files. Preserve the
  logging hooks (os.log categories) used by the examples so app developers can correlate runtime
  metrics with pipeline validation output.
- When introducing new Swift sources, accompany them with integration notes in the README or
  inline doc comments so app developers understand how to wire them into Xcode projects.
