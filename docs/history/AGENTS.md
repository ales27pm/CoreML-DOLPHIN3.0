# Session History Guidance

This scope covers `docs/history/` including `SESSION_LOG.md`.

- Never edit session entry blocks by handâ€”run `tools/session_finalize.py` to append updates.
- Keep introductory context accurate and reference the automation manifest when adjusting structure.
- Use this directory for canonical logs only; additional playbooks belong elsewhere in `docs/`.
