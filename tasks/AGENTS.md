# Tasks & Session Notes Guidance

This scope applies to everything under `tasks/`.

- Keep task implementations production-ready with exhaustive tests and documentation.
- For `tasks/SESSION_NOTES.md`, never edit the auto-managed session blocks manuallyâ€”use the
  session finalizer to append entries.
- When authoring new tasks, document validation commands and cross-reference the Codex ledger
  section that tracks the task.
- Maintain parity between Python, Rust, Go, and TypeScript implementations referenced in the
  Codex dashboard.
