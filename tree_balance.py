"""Command line tool for Task 2 â€“ Balanced Binary Tree Validator.

This script exposes a small demonstration harness around
``tasks.core_algorithmic_foundations.balanced_binary_tree`` so the behaviour
outlined in ``Codex_Master_Task_Results.md`` can be exercised directly from the
command line.  Running the module prints balance checks for both a perfectly
balanced tree and an intentionally skewed tree together with their level-order
ASCII renderings.

The script remains intentionally dependency-free: the heavy lifting occurs in
``balanced_binary_tree`` where comprehensive validation and helpers such as
``render_tree`` live.  Here we simply orchestrate pre-defined demo inputs and
emit human-readable status lines.
